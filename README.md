# BigNumArithmetic-Project
Infinite precision arithmetic for non-negative numbers
The BigNumArithmetic.java main function requires a command-file as an argument.
This command-file contains operations in Reverse Polish Notation.
The main function then outputs each of the operations and their result (blank if invalid operation) to the console.

COMMAND-FILE example:
