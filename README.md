# BigNumArithmetic-Project
Infinite precision arithmetic package for non-negative numbers
The BigNumArithmetic.java main function takes the filename of a command-file as an argument.
This command-file contains operations in Reverse Polish Notation.
The main function then outputs each of the operations completed and their result (blank if invalid operation).
